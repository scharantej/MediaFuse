## Flask Application Design for a Multi-Platform Search Engine

### HTML Files
- **index.html**: This file serves as the main page of the application. It contains the user interface elements, such as a search bar, platform filters, and a display area for search results.

### Routes
- **search**: This route handles the search request from the user. It fetches the search results from the Reddit, YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram APIs based on the user's input. The results are then rendered in the `index.html` page.
- **error**: This route handles any errors that occur during the search process. It provides helpful feedback to the user in case of any issues.
